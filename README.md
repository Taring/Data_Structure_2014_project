+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Thanks for help from Juda and Gaoyu.
Here is the following history of modifying code:

ArrayList.h:

LinkedList.h:

Deque.h:
167: "-1" was added behind "save_size"
PriorityQueue:
354: Change to line:351 & 352
HashMap:

TreeMap:
Renew the function: Entry* Find_min(const &Key)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

tester.cpp(with testcases.h & unittest.h) is the test to check your classes except PriorityQueue.
Thanks for Ted Yin provided the code last year.
I correct and renew it on 5/24/2014.

Thanks for Zhihao Bai & Mars's help.
I'm glad to stay up with them.
